#### Human Activity Recognition

In this project our goal is to predict, through machine learning techniques, if a weight lifiting exercise is being done properly.

We have data from accelerometers put on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of six young healthy participants who were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions.

Done in R programming language.
